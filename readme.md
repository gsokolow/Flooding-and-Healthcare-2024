## Abstract

A month of heavy rainfall on the North Island in January 2023 saturated the soils and rivers of Te Matau-a-Māui Hawke's Bay. [1](https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disasters/2023-new-zealand-floods/) 
When Cyclone Gabrielle hit in February, the region experienced "widespread damage and flooding. [...] Over 70,000 residents were left without lifelines including health services, power, road connectivity (in every direction), waste water, drinking water, internet, and cellphone networks. [2](https://www.napier.govt.nz/our-council/cyclone-gabrielle/#:~:text=February%2014%202023%20is%20a,of%20extreme%20isolation%20and%20vulnerability.)
Cyclone Gabrielle was not simply a destructive anomaly. Climate change is increasing storm frequency and intensity worldwide. [3](https://www.oecd.org/climate-action/ipac/the-climate-action-monitor-2023-60e338a2/chapter-d1e1621) 
In order to prepare ourselves for the climate-altered future that is coming, and indeed, perhaps already here, it is essential that we understand the potential impacts of severe precipitation events and to whom they pose the greatest risks. In this study, I will investigate the health care access impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle by calculating the travel time from small scale statistical geometries in Te Matau-a-Maui, Hawkes Bay, to the nearest primary care provider, before and after cyclone-induced road closures. Results will be contextualized using population demographics, to better understand how the burden of disaster damage may be unevenly distributed along socioeconomic lines.
